/* 
 * TODO: Design the CSS styling for the chat application
 * 
 * You need to create a professional and user-friendly design for the chat interface.
 * Consider styling:
 * - The container layout
 * - Status indicator (connected/disconnected states)
 * - Nickname input section
 * - Chat messages area with scrolling
 * - Message bubbles (regular vs system messages)
 * - Timestamps
 * - Input section for typing messages
 * - Buttons
 * - Overall color scheme and typography
 * 
 * Make sure to:
 * - Use appropriate colors to distinguish system messages from regular messages
 * - Ensure the chat messages area is scrollable
 * - Make the interface responsive and visually appealing
 * - Style the status indicator to show connection state clearly
